# Lesson 02. Control operators.

## Get the latest code from the main repo

If you are doing this for the first time please see [the previous
instruction](../lesson-01-data-types/README.md).

Go to the `java-lessons` directory.
```
cd java-lessons
```

Pull the latest changes to your local repo:
```
git checkout main
git pull vsbogd main
```

Push the latest changes to your fork:
```
git push origin main
```

Now you should have `lesson-02-control-operators` directory.

## Implement "Guess a number" game

Look at the `GuessNumber.java` file. It contains the code which generates a
random number. Add your code to implement a simple gusssing number game
according the rules which are explained in the file.

If it is easy to you then try to implement another variant of the game. Let
user guess the number from 1 to 100 and write a program which will guess the
number in 10 attempts. Put this program into separate file
`ReversedGuess.java`.

As usual compile your code and check if it works. If your code works as
expected then commit and push the changes:
```
git add .
git commit
git push origin main
```
