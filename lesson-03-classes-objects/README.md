# Lesson 03. Classes and objects

As usual get latest changes into your repo:
```
git checkout main
git pull vsbogd main
```

Look at the `Rectangle.java`, implement the `perimeter` method.
Create new instance of `Rectangle` and call the `show` method.

Compile your code and check if it works. If your code works as
expected then commit and push the changes:
```
git add .
git commit
git push origin main
```
