# Lesson 06. Hierarchy of classes.

Write a program which gets the list of strings from keyboard and then prints
this list in sorted order. To enter the list enter the number of items first
then enter each item on separate line. To compare strings use method
[String.compareTo](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)).
`a.compareTo(b)` returns 0 when `a` and `b` are equal, a value less then 0 when
`a` is lexicographically less than `b`, and a value greater than 0 otherwise.
You can use any sorting algorithm you know.

Example input:
```
4
elephant
dog
cat
mice
```

Example output:
```
cat
dog
elephant
mice
```
